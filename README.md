Hyperspectral quantitative phase microscopy 
The matlab file "Simulation_of_Hyperspectral_phase_maps.m" contains the code for simulating phase map corresponding to different wavelengths
The matlab file " Hyperspectral_phase_variation.m" contains the code for stacking the phase maps fo frm a hypercube
The data corresponding to the waveguides and cells is uploaded in the zip file as DATA
